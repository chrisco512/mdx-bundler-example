title: Post with cool component
---

import Cool from "./cool"

This is my second post.

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `mdx-bundler`.

Now I will render a cool component from the same folder.

<Cool/>

I'm also using custom Link Component

Go back [home](/).
